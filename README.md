Patients arrive to hospital in the emergency department. They are formally admitted to the hospital once they have been triaged. Typically, they undergo a CT scan to diagnose the stroke, followed by intravenous thrombolysis (TPA) to break up the blood clot. This is time sensitive and critical that they occur as soon as possible. Some patients may spend time in the intensive care unit (ICU). Afterward, they are transferred to the neurology ward, where they are seen by a variety of medical specialists while they recover. The total length of time spent in hospital may range from a couple of days to a few weeks.
